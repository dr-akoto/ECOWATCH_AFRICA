            <h2>The Devastating Effects</h2>
            <p>Africa faces severe environmental challenges due to rampant deforestation. Critical ecosystems, like the Congo Basin, are rapidly shrinking, and with them, the continent’s natural defenses against climate change.</p>

            <div class="impact-card">
                <h3>Biodiversity Loss</h3>
                <p>Home to unique species, Africa’s forests are vital for biodiversity. Deforestation has led to habitat destruction, threatening species with extinction and destabilizing ecosystems.</p>

            <div class="impact-card">
                <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                <p>Forests like the Congo Basin play a critical role in sequestering carbon. As deforestation accelerates, carbon emissions increase, exacerbating global warming and regional droughts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="impact-card">
                <h3>Water Supply & Agriculture</h3>
                <p>Deforestation affects rainfall patterns, reducing water availability for agriculture. This disrupts food production and livelihoods, increasing the vulnerability of rural communities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="impact-card">
                <h3>Socio-economic Impact</h3>
                <p>Local communities depend on forests for resources like food, fuel, and medicine. The loss of forest areas limits access to these resources, deepening poverty and inequality.</p>
